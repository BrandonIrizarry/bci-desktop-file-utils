***** Parsing .desktop files
This is mainly applicable to a minimalist AntiX setup. The end goal is
to generate a Fluxbox menu with applications found in /usr/share/applications.

This code returns a list pairing desktop files (found in
/usr/share/applications) with a list of assigned categories, which
presumably are used to locate that application within a WM/DE menu.
